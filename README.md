### FPS Core is again under active development. For more details, please check out the V2.0.0 branch [here](https://github.com/whoisEllie/FPSCore/tree/v2.0.0?tab=readme-ov-file).

**FPS Core is a simple, easy-to-use plugin that makes building shooters in Unreal Engine faster and easier**

It abstracts a number of core functions and behaviours (hence, FPS Core) to pre-made C++ classes while exposing their properties to Blueprints, allowing anyone to modify their functionality - even if you don't know how to code. Ready to get started? Grab it from the [marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/fps-core) and get started with the online [documentation](https://emmadocs.dev)!

### installation

You'll likely have the best experience installing FPS Core through the [Unreal Engine Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/fps-core). This way you get the most up-to-date production ready binaries, so there's no compilation required.

If you'd like to compile your own copy, you can clone from the main branch without hesitation - this is always kept up to date with the latest stable release, and mirrors the version found on the Unreal Engine Marketplace. In order to download bleeding-edge releases, you'll have to pull from a branch.

### alternate versions

If you're looking for versions of FPS Core with support for alternate features, you might find them in some public forks. Notable forks are listed here.

- (https://github.com/TheMarcusDev/FPSCore): This fork by Marcus Henrique is fully replicated, and has modifications that bring it closer to a CS-style game, such as sprint being the default movement state.

### learning and docs

The best way to get started with FPS Core is by following the QuickStart! series on the [documentation site](https://whoisellie.github.io/OpenFPS-Quartz/). You can find the first part of that [here](https://whoisellie.github.io/OpenFPS-Quartz/FPS-Core/Quickstart/Quickstart-part-1). Currently, there is no complete API reference.

### getting help

Unfortunately, as FPS Core is no longer in development, I am unable to provide support.

### contributing

Contributions are welcomed! Whether you're working on bug fixes, adding new features or commenting, I'm always happy to discuss outside changes to the plugin - make a PR and let's chat!

### license

FPS Core is licensed under an MIT license, a permissive license that places few restrictions on reuse. Wherever you're planning to use FPS Core, you're probably fine! You can read more in the [LICENSE](LICENSE).
