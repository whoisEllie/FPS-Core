**FPS Core is a simple, easy-to-use plugin that makes building shooters in Unreal Engine faster and easier**

It abstracts a number of core functions and behaviours (hence, FPS Core) to pre-made C++ classes while exposing their properties to Blueprints, allowing anyone to modify their functionality - even if you don't know how to code. This version of FPS Core is still in development. Please do not use it in any production code, as the APIs are in constant flux and _will_ change.

### features

- **TBD!**

### installation

For now, if you'd like to test v2.0, you'll have to clone this GitHub repository into `YourUEProject/Plugins/`, and build it from C++. Binaries will be available closer to release.

### learning and docs

At the moment, FPS Core v2 has no documentation. You can try to extrapolate core concepts from the original [documentation site](https://whoisellie.github.io/OpenFPS-Quartz/), but as the new APIs are very different, you may struggle. Don't hesitate to ask questions in the #v2 chat in the [discord](https://discord.gg/nyjkvET4UN). Proper documentation will follow a more stable API release.

### getting help

FPS Core v2 is in early development right now, but if you'd like to discuss the project, provide feedback and give suggestions, you can do so in the #v2 channel in the [FPS Core discord](https://discord.gg/nyjkvET4UN)!

### contributing

Contributions are welcomed! Whether you're working on bug fixes, adding new features or commenting, I'm always happy to discuss outside changes to the plugin - make a PR and let's chat!

### license

FPS Core is licensed under an MIT license, a permissive license that places few restrictions on reuse. Wherever you're planning to use FPS Core, you're probably fine! You can read more in the [LICENSE](LICENSE).
